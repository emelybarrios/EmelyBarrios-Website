          Hello! My name is Emely Barrios and I am a first-year Political Science major. I am a first generation student here at UC Riverside. Some of my past-times include hiking, watching movies, and playing piano. This year I started my first year at a university and I was able to observe how school works at a university level. This year I plan on getting more involved in campus events. I am an active member of my church community and serve as the worship leader and youth group vice president. Some things that make me a diligent worker is that I know how to plan accordingly, be productive, and get everything done that needs to be completed. I am bilingual as I speak both English and Spanish fluently. I am able to type at 82 words per minute. In high school, I took two years of speech and debate where I argued my topics in front of an audience therefore, I have experience in public speaking. Some of my awards were first place in my debate tournaments, winning the county championship with my mock trial team, and graduating with above a 4.0 GPA in high school. I am currently involved in two on-campus activities. I am a member of UCRâ€™s Navigators, a religious group and also UCRâ€™s Global Human and Legal Brigades. I attend my Navigator meeting weekly and my GHLB meeting as well. Although I am not as involved in college, my plan is to become more schedule oriented and make the best out of the experience.<br><br>

        Some of my past experiences include working at Kern Schools Credit Union my senior year of high school as a bank teller. I also tutored a sixth grader with math and english problems he did not understand. Some summers, I would go work with my father at his paint and drywall company.I was also the treasurer for my youth group in years past as well as treasurer for my high schoolâ€™s Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de AztlÃ¡n club. In high school, I was very involved in extracurriculars. I played softball for two years and I was on the cheer team as well. My youth group and I did many community service hours whether it be feeding the homeless for Christmas and Thanksgiving, giving food to those less fortunate in the Jesus Shack Street Team events, and volunteering at my local zooâ€™s Holiday Lights during the Christmas season. In high school, I was also involved in community service clubs such as National Honor Society and Spanish Honor Society where I completed over 100 hours of community service. As I was involved in these clubs and sports, I was still able to graduate with a 4.0 GPA and complete all of my leadership requirements in order to maintain membership status in these clubs. During these times, I was also very involved in church. I attend weekly church services every Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday where I lead worship on two of those days. I plan to maintain this balanced schedule in my time at University of California, Riverside. My plan is to become more involved in college as I was in high school and make the best out of my college experience along with my colleagues.<br><br>
